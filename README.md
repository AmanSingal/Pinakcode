Covid-19 Fake News Detector

Fake news can be any content that is not truthful and is generated to convince its readers to believe in something that is not true. 
The challenge for fake news detection comes with the democratization of news sources, and how easy modern technology makes sharing news 
articles in the age of social media.


The Covid-19 Fake News Detector is a GUI that detects fake news, without compromising privacy, and is based on machine learning algorithms. 
When a user enters a message in the textbox provided on the interface, it accurately detects whether the news is fake or genuine based on 
the dataset of sorted messages from various official sources.
